<h1>Practice Folder</h1>

You can create any folder or Kotlin file within this folder for your personal practice or testing.

Since this folder doesn't come under to git tracking thus it will not be affecting your contribution (in case you are 
making one).

_**Do not forget to make a file for yourself ðŸ˜‰**_
