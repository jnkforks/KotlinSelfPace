Learn Kotlin with your own pace. A topic a day or a subtopic, your choice completely. Topics of Kotlin native and a few related to Android will be explained in the simplest way as possible with 
examples.

There will be a separate folder named `practice` inside `src` in which you can create your own files for practice that will not be 
under version control so don't worry. You can yourself see how it works.


## Steps to Run Project

You have to set up the Kotlin in order to run the project. 
- Install [JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- Enable/Install [Kotlin Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6954-kotlin)
- Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Now, you need to know some commands that have to run on either terminal or cmd.

> Go to your desired destination where you want to clone the project, then do the following:

```$ git clone https://github.com/sagargkr/KotlinSelfPace.git```

Then open `KotlinSelfPace` in your IntelliJ IDEA.<br>
If prompt appears to enable the Kotlin, just set it up, and you're done.

Since this [repository](https://github.com/sagargkr/KotlinSelfPace) will get updated on master time to time, thus you 
have to pull the `master` again with time to your local `master`. For this, execute the following statement:


```$ git pull origin master --rebase```

> After that the new changes will be there in the project.

_**Note:** Do not try to change files in src. You have `practice` package for doing tests and any trials._ 

## Table of Contents

- [var & val](/src/first_varvalworld)
- [Data Types](/src/data_types)

> More Coming Soon ðŸ˜‰

## Contributing to Project

In order to make contributions to the project you have to `fork` the project. Then you have to clone it in your local 
by the following commands:

```$ git clone https://github.com/<your-user-name>/KotlinSelfPace.git ```

> Go into the project directory

```$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/sagargkr/KotlinSelfPace.git```

> Check for the `origin` and `upstream` by following command:

```$ git remote -v```

> You will find the below results : <br>
> ```origin  https://github.com/<your-user-name>/KotlinSelfPace.git (fetch)```<br>
> ```origin  https://github.com/<your-user-name>/KotlinSelfPace.git (push)```<br>
> ```upstream  https://github.com/sagargkr/KotlinSelfPace.git (fetch)```<br>
> ```upstream  https://github.com/sagargkr/KotlinSelfPace.git (push)```<br>

If you get the above results, then you're done! :smile: <br>
Now, make a new branch by doing ```$ git checkout -b branch-name```, where branch-name should be meaningful one.
Do your work, then do ```$ git add ``` & ```$ git commit``` before making push make sure you have pulled the changes 
at master by doing :

```$ git pull upstream master --rebase```

Push the branch to the Github by ```$ git push origin branch-name```, Come back to your forked repository and 
click on green color button namely, ```Compare & Make Pull Request```. Launch the PR(Pull Request) and wait for it to 
be reviewed and merged. 

### Update
For now this repo will get updates regularly or as soon as I will be getting to add new things about Kotlin.
