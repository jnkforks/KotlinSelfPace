# Kotlin Self Pace

Learn Kotlin with your own pace. A topic a day or a subtopic, your choice completely.

<p>Here, topics of Kotlin native and a few related to Android will be explained in the simplest way as possible with 
examples.<br>
There will be a separate folder named  <i><b>practice</b></i> in which you can create your own files for practice that will not be 
under version control so don't worry. You can yourself see how it works.
</p>

### Updates
For now this repo will get updates regularly or as soon as I will be getting to add new things about Kotlin.
